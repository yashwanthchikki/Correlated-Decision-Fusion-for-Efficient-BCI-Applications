# Correlated-Decision-Fusion-for-Efficient-BCI-Applications
This project explores a novel Correlated Decision Fusion (CDF) approach to improve Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) efficiency by integrating gesture recognition as a correlated feature. Unlike traditional ensemble methods, CDF aligns decision-making models through correlation, ensuring higher accuracy and lower computational costs.
